 Octopus: an HPX octree-based 3D AMR framework
===============================================

Octopus is a parallel, distributed 3D framework for crafting scientific
simulations that use adaptive mesh refinment (AMR) methods. The primary
application focus is hydrodynamics astrophysics codes. Octopus uses the `HPX
C++11 runtime system <http://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`_ and an
octree-based AMR algorithm. The code is based off of work originally done by
Dominic Marcello.

Octopus is developed by the STE||AR group at Louisiana State University's 
Center for Computation and Technology. The primary developer is Bryce
Adelstein-Lelbach.
