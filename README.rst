 Octopus: an HPX octree-based 3D AMR framework
===============================================

Octopus is a parallel, distributed 3D framework for crafting scientific
simulations that use adaptive mesh refinment (AMR) methods. The primary
application focus is hydrodynamics astrophysics codes. Octopus uses the `HPX
C++11 runtime system <github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`_ and an
octree-based AMR algorithm. The code is based off of work originally done by
Dominic Marcello.

Octopus is developed at `Louisiana State University <lsu.edu>`_ through the
joint effort of `the STE||AR group <stellar.cct.lsu.edu>`_ at the `Center for
Computation and Technology <cct.lsu.edu>`_ and `the Department of Physics
<phys.lsu.edu>`_. The primary developers are Bryce Adelstein-Lelbach and Zach
Byerly. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation through award
1240655 (STAR).
