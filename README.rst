 Octopus: an HPX octree-based 3D AMR framework
===============================================

Octopus is a parallel, distributed 3D framework for crafting scientific
simulations that use adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods. The primary
application focus is Eulerian astrophysics codes. Octopus uses the `HPX C++11
runtime system <github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`_ and an octree-based AMR
algorithm. The code is based off of work originally done by Dominic Marcello.

Octopus is developed at `Louisiana State University <lsu.edu>`_ through the
joint effort of `the STE||AR group <stellar.cct.lsu.edu>`_ at the `Center for
Computation and Technology <cct.lsu.edu>`_ and `the Department of Physics
<phys.lsu.edu>`_. The primary developers are Bryce Adelstein-Lelbach and Zach
Byerly.
