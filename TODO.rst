Short-term todo list
====================

So I don't forget things overnight.

* Add injection in create_child.
* Implement AMR/physical bounds client-side via type-punning.
* Set up AMR/physical bounds in (set|tie).*sibling functions.
* Add interface for defining the problem (e.g. defining the science_table).
* Add some type of I/O for verification.
