Flow Off
--------

14:18 < zbyerly_> [FO/flow_off] the flow of material out of the grid
14:18 < zbyerly_> if you want to allow stuff to leave the grid but still measure conservation, you have to track it
14:18 < zbyerly_> it might be used in the diagnostics

14:20 <@wash> zbyerly_: you want it ported?
14:20 < zbyerly_> yes please
14:20 < zbyerly_> but not critical for the demo probably
14:20 <@wash> zbyerly_: Well, we need to make sure the code works.
14:21 < zbyerly_> will be important afterwards for sure
14:21 < zbyerly_> yeah

14:22 <@wash> zbyerly_: So it records the material that leaves each zone?
14:23 <@wash> zbyerly_: (FO is a grid, same size as U)
14:23 < zbyerly_> i'm not sure why it's needed for every zone
14:23 < zbyerly_> should just be needed for the outer zones

14:26 <@wash> zbyerly_: (doesn't enforce_outflow() well, enforce outflow?)
14:27 <@wash> enforce_outflow is in State
14:27 < zbyerly_> yeah
14:28 < zbyerly_> the outer boundary zones
14:28 < zbyerly_> you don't want mass to accidentally flow into the grid from the ghost cells
14:28 <@wash> zbyerly_: ah, so enforce outflow is different than this?
14:29 < zbyerly_> yeah enforcing outflow is different than measuring what flows out
14:29 <@wash> zbyerly_: but enforce_outflow is only done on physical boundaries. And measuring what flows out should only be important on the boundaries
14:30 < zbyerly_> i think i agree
14:30 < zbyerly_> are you just suggesting that we combine the two?

Source
------

14:08 < zbyerly_> all units are relative to each other
14:09 < zbyerly_> source is a source term for the conservation equation for that variable
14:09 < zbyerly_> so mass has no source term
14:10 < zbyerly_> momentum has one due to gravity
