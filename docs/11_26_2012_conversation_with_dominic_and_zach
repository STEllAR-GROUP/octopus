Linearized GR solver - Linearized version of the Einstein field questions (4 degrees of freedom)
Elements of Numerical Relativity - Z4 formalism for general relativity
Appx 5000 timesteps per orbit at 5 levels of refinement
Timestep sizes with GR solver are appx 10 orders of magnitude slower
Jay Call's paper
Run different simulations with different ranges of inaccuracies
Start when the stream is optically thin
Would have to figure out what mass transfer rate would give us an optically thin stream
